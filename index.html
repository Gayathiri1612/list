         community in Mumbai,who formed the first <mark>Indian cricket club </mark>in 1848</p>
    <li><u>Expansions and termination</u></li>

    <li><u>Tournament format</u></li>
    <p>Tournament structures dictate how competitors are matched and progress through a
         competition.
         Common formats include single elimination, double elimination, and round robin, each 
         with distinct rules for advancement and elimination. Single elimination
         is quick but unforgiving, while double elimination offers a second chance.</p>
<li><u>Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries</u></li>
<p>Player acquisition in leagues like the IPL typically involves auctions, 
    trading, and free agency, with salaries structured based on player contracts and
     performance. Teams can acquire players through auctions where franchises bid on players 
     with pre-set base prices, or through trading with other teams, with any salary
      differences covered by the acquiring team. Free agency, or replacement signings, 
      can occur before or during the season, especially for injured or unavailable players. </p>
<li><u>Match rules</u></li>
<p>Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players. 
    The game involves two central phases: batting and bowling/fielding.
     The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets,
      while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen and restrict their scoring.
     The team with the most runs at the end of the match wins.   </p>

<p>Over the years, the IPL prize money has grown exponentially; DDCA wins
